# AdventureWorks-Hard-Challenges
AdventureWorks Hard Challenges Repository to go AdventureWorks Hard Challenges Project

As I am wanting to make a start in my Data Analysis career, I have decided to go on Github to demonstrate my SQL syntax skills. I am going to https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/AdventureWorks_hard_questions for the challenges to complete.
I have SQL Server Management Studio installed on my laptop and I have downloaded the BAK file AdventureWorksLT2019.bak to follow along with the exercises.
I am able to run the queries within the SQL Server Management Studio environment and then run the query again in https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/AdventureWorks_hard_questions to see if the query I had run was correct.
Attached to this repository is the BAK file, code snippets of the code ran when executing the queries, and the result I gathered from the query.
